### Tailfin Assembly

If you have never cut control surfaces into foamboard, I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1_pjhQWj98)   

Print out the tailfin templates. The PDF is already sized for 8.5x11" printer paper. Do not rescale the page or apply margins. Tape the pages together and cut out the templates.  
<img src="./images/construction/TAIL_0.jpg" width="600">

Use a ruler to tansfer the outline of the template onto the foamboard. Cut out the foam pieces. Make the half cuts and 45-degree cuts to add control surfaces. Use packing tape to reinforce the bending parts.  
<img src="./images/construction/TAIL_1.jpg" width="600">

Glue the vertical and horizontal stabilizer together.   
<img src="./images/construction/TAIL_2.jpg" width="600">

Glue the tailfin mount to the underside of the tail fins and use a screwdriver to puncture holes through the horizontal stabilizer. Secure the tailfin reinforcements to the tailfin mount with two 20mm length M2 screws and two 8mm M2 screws. You may optionally glue down the tailfin reinforcements to add extra rigidity to the vertical stabilizer.  
<img src="./images/construction/TAIL_3.jpg" width="600">

### Wing Assembly

I would recommend watching [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJZoqGHAIDE) to understand the basic design of this wing. The wing is attached to the pod with four M4 screws, and can be swapped out for your own custom design. The design I am using is a called an "Armin wing" in the hobbyist community. [Kline-Fogelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kline%E2%80%93Fogleman_airfoil) airfoils may be simpler to build, and should provide a larger wing area for the same quanitity of foamboard.  

Cut out the left and right wing templates and tape them the same way as the tailfin templates. Transfer the templates onto foamboard, and cut them out. One piece of 20"x30" foamboard should yield two wings.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_2.jpg" width="600">

Cut each of the blue dashed lines halfway through the foamboard. This will become the leading edge of the wing. Do a 45-degree cut on the dashed line that is labeled.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_2_1.jpg" width="1200">

Here is what the scored section of the wing should look like after cutting.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_3.jpg" width="600">

Each wing will require three 5mm by 600mm foam spars. There are no templates for these, just cut them out with a ruler. These spars will "sandwich" a removable central carbon fiber spar.  

Example carbon fiber spar placement.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_3_1.jpg" width="600">

Pyramid sandwich example.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_3_2.jpg" width="600">

The folding step is a bit difficult to describe. I recommend watching [this video](https://youtu.be/bllvhjr51Lk?si=4DFRSW2RofPoi4HL&t=564) from timestamps 9:30 to 12:30 if you are a beginner and you struggle to assemble the wing. My wing design is *heavily* inspired by the wing on the Joytrainer Mini, and the construction techniques are identical.

Using the Wing Screw Plate as a guide, use a screwdriver to puncture the fully-glued wing with 4 holes.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_4.jpg" width="600">

Insert four 30mm length M4 screws into the wing.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_5.jpg" width="600">

<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_6.jpg" width="600">

Insert your servos into the servo fairings and secure them with screws. 

> You will need to make sure your servos are facing different directions on each wing so that the ailerons move in opposite directions. Corrections are made at the end of this section.    

<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_7.jpg" width="600">

Glue your servo fairings and control horns into the area of the wing marked on the template.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_8.jpg" width="600">

Make sure your control horns are held in place with a tab on the other side.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_9.jpg" width="600">

You can connect your servo horn and control horn with a piece of bent 1.2mm wire. Here is some I bent myself.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_10.jpg" width="600">

You can also use the special screw-tightened nylon clips from the bill of materials.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_11.jpg" width="600">

Cut a hole near the servo for us to run the servo cable through. This hole is a bit large, feel free to make it smaller.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_12.jpg" width="600">

I bend a stiff 0.8mm wire into a hook shape for pulling the servo cable through.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_13.jpg" width="600">

Connect the servo cable to a 6" servo cable extender. Then it should be long enough to be pulled all the way through.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_14.jpg" width="600">

<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_15.jpg" width="600">

Use packing tape to cover the hole.  
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_16.jpg" width="600">

#### CORRECTION ON WING SERVOS

Both aileron servos are controlled via the same PWM channel. But we want them to actuate in the opposite direction of one another. We will need to make sure each servo on each wing is facing the opposite direction. The absolute direction doesn't matter, because we can always invert the servo controls in the mix during the electronics configuration step.  

<img src="./images/construction/SERVO_1.jpg" width="600">
<img src="./images/construction/SERVO_2.jpg" width="600">

Ignore that one of the servos did not fit the fairing properly. I made this discovery late in the design process, and didn't have time to print a mirrored servo fairing. Future versions of the build guide will have this corrected.  

### Final Assembly

#### Connecting the Tailfin Assembly and Pod Assembly

Next we are going to connect the tailfin assembly to the pod assembly. We are going to be limited by the length of our pushrods, so we will use them to get an idea for how long the tail needs to be.  
<img src="./images/construction/A1.jpg" width="600">

Cut holes for the control horns.  
<img src="./images/construction/A2.jpg" width="600">

In order to reduce bending, you can use a pushrod guide on the carbon fiber boom. Make sure it is in a position where the control rods are not pushing too hard against the walls of the guide. Secure it in place with glue.  
<img src="./images/construction/A2_1.jpg" width="600">

Connecting the tailfin assembly to the pod is the most challenging part of the build because you are at the mercy of the pushrods, and you cannot make changes in an arbitrary order (for example, you cannot hook the pushrod into the servos after connecting the pushrods to the control surfaces)

I find that the easiest order to do things in is:
1. Hook pushrods into servo horns
2. Slide carbon fiber boom into wing rail
3. Slide wire guide onto boom, and insert pushrods
4. Attach tailfin assembly onto carbon fiber boom
5. Tweak tailfin assembly position, and pushrod connector positions until the control surfaces are trim when the pushrod is taut without slack.

Example of tailfin assembly control surfaces with connectors and pushrods.  
<img src="./images/construction/A3.jpg" width="600">

Use a piece of tape to mark the location of the tailfin assembly. Remove the carbon fiber boom from the pod. Insert the carbon fiber boom into the tailfin assembly, and use glue to secure it permanently in place.  
<img src="./images/construction/A4.jpg" width="600">

Next we will use the carbon fiber boom clamp to clamp the boom in place on the pod. I add a dab of hot glue into the clamp to increase friction, since the hot glue is more malleable than the PETG and will "squish" onto it more. 

> Sidenote, due to the nature of the clamping force, I expect that this piece might experience significant creep over long periods of time. You should check that the tailfin is solidly secured before flying after a long period of inactivity.  

<img src="./images/construction/A5.jpg" width="600">

Make sure the tailfin is aligned before finalizing the position with the boom clamp.  
<img src="./images/construction/A6.jpg" width="600">

The boom clamp can be placed anywhere on the rail, but this position is the best (you will see why later). Use two 16mm length M2 screws to tighten the clamp.  
<img src="./images/construction/A7.jpg" width="600">

Once the tailfin position is finalized, you can make fine adjustments to the control surfaces by tweaking the amount of "choke" on the control horn clips.

#### Balancing the Wings

TODO: ADD LINK TO WING BALANCING IN EDUCATIONAL REPO

Wing balancing is incredibly important if we want to have good flight characteristics. Due to the modular nature of this drone, I designed a wing mounting rail that allows the wing position to be adjusted so that the Center of Lift can be repositioned for different payloads.

The Wing Rail Screw Receivers have two slots for M4 nuts. Before use, I use 30mm length M4 screws to hold the nuts in position, then apply superglue or hot glue to the nut so that it will not fall out of the slot when the screw is removed. Be careful not to get glue on the M4 screws, or you will be unable to remove them without dislodging the nut as well.  
<img src="./images/construction/A10.jpg" width="600">

Here are the Wing Rail Screw Receivers after the glue has dried.   
<img src="./images/construction/A11.jpg" width="600">

Wing balancing is pointless unless the drone is loaded with our expected payload. For this build I am using a 3S 2200MAh battery, a 30A ESC, and a BetaFPV Micro ELRS receiver. I attach the scratchy side of the velcro to the pod, since the fuzzy side wears out more quickly. Also the scratchy side picks up hair and grass and it is easier to keep clean if it stays inside the drone.  
<img src="./images/construction/A12.jpg" width="600">

Here the pod is packed with electronics.  
<img src="./images/construction/A13.jpg" width="600">

Using two objects of the same height with a small point of contact, balance your plane so that it is level.  
<img src="./images/construction/A14.jpg" width="600">

We adjust our wing's position on the rail until we find a good balance point.  
<img src="./images/construction/A16.jpg" width="600">

Here we can see that the plane is balanced when the point of contact is about 25-30% of the wing's width away from the leading edge. A good rule of thumb is for your center of gravity to be at 1/4th of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord, which for our purposes is just the width of the wing. Once a good balance point is found, mark the location of your Wing Rail Screw Receivers on the rail with a sharpie or pen.  
<img src="./images/construction/A15.jpg" width="600">

Using the marks made earlier, glue the Wing Rail Screw Receivers onto the rail. This will be a fairly weak joint that is broken easily by pushing down too hard, so when attaching the wing do so carefully. The wing can be mounted on an un-glued Wing Rail Screw Receiver, but it is a pain.  
<img src="./images/construction/A17.jpg" width="600">

#### Adding Fairings

When attaching the front fairing to the motor mount, apply a small amount of hot glue around the base of the cylinder. Then you can just slide the mount on.  
<img src="./images/construction/A19.jpg" width="600">

TODO: design the rear fairing (it is harder than you think!!!)

### FINISHED
