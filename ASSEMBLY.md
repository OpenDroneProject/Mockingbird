### Tailfin Assembly

If you have never cut control surfaces into foamboard, I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1_pjhQWj98)

Print out the tailfin templates. The PDF is already sized for 8.5x11" printer paper. Do not rescale the page or apply margins. Tape the pages together and cut out the templates.

Use a ruler to tansfer the outline of the template onto the foamboard. Cut out the foam pieces. Make the half cuts and 45-degree cuts to add control surfaces. Use packing tape to reinforce the bending parts.

Glue the vertical and horizontal stabilizer together.

### Wing Assembly

I would recommend watching [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJZoqGHAIDE) to understand the basic design of this wing. The wing is attached to the pod with four M4 screws, and can be swapped out for your own custom design. The design I am using is a called an "Armin wing" in the hobbyist community. [Kline-Fogelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kline%E2%80%93Fogleman_airfoil) airfoils may be simpler to build, and should provide a larger wing area for the same quanitity of foamboard.

Cut out the left and right wing templates and tape them the same way as the tailfin templates. Transfer the templates onto foamboard, and cut them out. One piece of 20"x30" foamboard should yield two wings.

Cut each of the blue dashed lines halfway through the foamboard. This will become the leading edge of the wing. Do a 45-degree cut on the dashed line that is labeled.

Here is what the scored section of the wing should look like after cutting.

Each wing will require three 5mm by 600mm foam spars. There are no templates for these, just cut them out with a ruler. These spars will "sandwich" a removable central carbon fiber spar.

Example carbon fiber spar placement.

The folding step is a bit difficult to describe. I recommend watching [this video](https://youtu.be/bllvhjr51Lk?si=4DFRSW2RofPoi4HL&t=564) from timestamps 9:30 to 12:30 if you are a beginner and you struggle to assemble the wing. My wing design is *heavily* inspired by the wing on the Joytrainer Mini, and the construction techniques are identical.

Use the Wing Screw Plate as a guide to puncture the fully-glued wing with 4 holes.

Insert four 30mm length M4 screws into the wing

Insert your servos into the servo fairings and secure them with screws. 
**NOTE** You will need to make sure your servos are facing different directions on each wing so that the ailerons move in opposite directions. Corrections are made at the end of this section.
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_7.jpg" width="400">

Glue your servo fairings and control horns into the area of the wing marked on the template.
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_8.jpg" width="400">

Make sure your control horns are held in place with a tab on the other side.
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_9.jpg" width="400">

You can connect your servo horn and control horn with a piece of bent 1.2mm wire. Here is some I bent myself.
<img src="./images/construction/WINGS_10.jpg" width="400">

You can also use the special screw-tightened nylon clips from the bill of materials.

Cut a hole near the servo for us to run the servo cable through.
