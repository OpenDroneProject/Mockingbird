## Tips and Tricks

**Print the Electronics Payload at an angle on the Bambu A1 Mini**
There may be temperature issues at the edges of the printing plate on the Bambu A1 mini. Try printing it at an angle to see if that helps at all.

**Do your wing balancing before you cut your push rods for the tailfin control surfaces to length**   
It is easier to adjust your balance by moving the tailfin length, so the length of your tailfin will be dependent on the balance. Once that is determined, then you can adjust the length of your pushrods.

**Use 1.2mm wire control rods for tail control surfaces**  
The tail control surfaces are far away from the servos, and 0.64mm piano wire will deform. 1.2mm wire is thick enough to withstand the forces, while also deflecting the desired amount along its path from the servo to the control surface.
