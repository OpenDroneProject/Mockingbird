## Maiden Flight Feedback

10mph winds with 25mph gusts

Cons: 

Extremely hard to handle in wind due to high aspect, low authority, and torsional displacement of tailfin.

- Too much torsional displacement in tail. Need to try Carbon Fiber tube instead of rod (this should also save on mass a bit)

- Low authority. Attach pushrods to the far end of the servo horn, but close end of the control surface horn.

- all controls had to be inverted. Left roll should raise left aileron, pitch up should raise elevator, yaw right should move rudder right. Document how to invert the mix in edge tx

Pros:
- 30mins estimated flight
- extremely good glide slop

## 3D CAD

Wing screw-in hole spacing: 40mm long, 30mm wide

1/13/2026 -- 730g fully-loaded
1/27/2026 -- 775g fully-loaded, no rear fairing

Estimated weight reduction from printing with OVERTURE PLA AIR, 30% per part.
Savings:
bottom fairing -- 10g
front fairing -- 6g
e payload -- 14g
total: 30g
new weight ~745g
