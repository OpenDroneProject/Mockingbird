## 3D CAD

Wing screw-in hole spacing: 40mm long, 30mm wide

1/13/2026 -- 730g fully-loaded

# PROTOTYPE FINISHED!

Questions:
- how long did it take to make? (1 hr assembly for 3D printed parts)
- how many materials did it require?

- [ ] update BOM
- [ ] tally final cost
- [ ] tally final weight (775g)

- [ ] add educational links to website

### Fly It

- [ ] compare flight with vs without front fairing
- [ ] compare flight with vs without middle fairing

- [ ] redesign rear fairing
    - [ ] bottom part
    - [ ] top part

### Create Step-By-Step construction guide
- [ ] markdown with images
- [ ] video

### Engineering Docs
- [ ] interface control document
- [ ] power budget
- [ ] mass growth allowance
- [ ] TRL assessment
- [ ] iterate
