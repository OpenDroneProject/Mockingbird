## 3D CAD

Wing screw-in hole spacing: 40mm long, 30mm wide

1/13/2026 -- 730g fully-loaded
1/27/2026 -- 775g fully-loaded, no rear fairing

Estimated weight reduction from printing with OVERTURE PLA AIR, 30% per part.
Savings:
bottom fairing -- 10g
front fairing -- 6g
e payload -- 14g
total: 30g
new weight ~745g

### WEBSITE TODO

- [ ] add educational links to website
- [ ] add corvus flight footage to website

### Performance Tuning
- [ ] compare flight with vs without front fairing
- [ ] compare flight with vs without middle fairing

### Engineering Docs
- [ ] interface control document
- [ ] power budget
- [ ] mass growth allowance
- [ ] TRL assessment
- [ ] iterate
